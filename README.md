This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `deployed version`
[Poke Test Marcio](https://poke-teste.now.sh/)

Why deploy to Now Servers? Due to my Heroku free tier is over. Can't deploy to Heroku servers without a credit card payment.
But i got a punch of other projects deployed there, as you can easily see at this GitHub account.
Due to use o Bootstrap CSS Framework, i'm not using SCSS or SASS compilers, just a couple of helper classes to style beyond the framework options.
